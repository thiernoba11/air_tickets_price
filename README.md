All the files contained in the datasets are in json format. And the data are observed from November 09, 2015 to May 09, 2016. 

## Sample data entry:

```
the query data is the folder name
|-"ArrivalStationCode":"BUD"     # code for the arrival station 
|-"CurrentDate":"30\/12\/2015"   # departure date
|-"Date":"20151230"              # departure date
|-"DepartureStationCode":"BCN"   # code for departure station
|-"Flights":[{
    |-"CarrierCode":"W6"         # NA
    |-"FlightNumber":"2376"      # flight number
    |-"STD":"09:15"              # departure time

|-"InMonth":"True"
|-"MinimumPrice":"â‚¬49.99"                         # price

```

## Sample feature extraction code in python
```
|-sample_data_extraction.py
```

### Extracted feature 1
```
feature 1: flight number -> dummy variables
feature 2: departure date interval from "20151109", because the first observed date is 20151109
feature 3: observed days before departure date
feature 4: minimum price before the observed date
feature 5: maximum price before the observed date
output: the date which has the minimum price from the observed date to departure date is set to 1;
        other entries set to 0
```

### Extracted feature 2
```
feature 1: flight number -> dummy variables
feature 2: departure date interval from "20151109", because the first observed date is 20151109
feature 3: observed days before departure date
feature 4: minimum price before the observed date
feature 5: maximum price before the observed date
output: the ticket price for each entry
```
